# Edit this file to include (only) the types you wish to support in your
#  LiquiDoc Ops instance.
# The slug property sets the default for how the type is expressed in URLs
# E.g., API reference URLs look like <docsite>/<prod>/<topic-slug>-api-reference
# This can be overwritten with the type-slug property.
# Slugs can be duplicates so long as the types will never be used with the same
#  core slug in the same path
