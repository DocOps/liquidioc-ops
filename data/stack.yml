        short: The discerning documentarian's lightweight markup format
        long: >
          The only markup language that thrills engineers and tech writers alike, AsciiDoc offers structured, semantic text in a standardized format.
          It's like if Markdown were designed by world-class engineers for pro-grade writing about software documentation, including dynamic features such as conditionalized content, variable substitution, and external source inclusion.
        fit: >
          A docs-as-code platform requires a lightweight markup format, and AsciiDoc is the best of these for structured, dynamic technical content.

      roles: [docpro,admin]
      desc:
        short: Extremely lightweight format for version-controllable data
        long: |
          For storing product data in version-controlled flat files accessible to writers and engineers, it's YAML to the rescue.
          Jekyll and other apps use YAML for configuration, so it's our one-stop shop for configs and small data.

      desc:
        short: Combine data, code, and text to generate anything
        long: |
          In use around the Web, Shopify's wickedly extensible, tag-based preprocessing language lets us massage small data into content, or else to restructure it.
          Jekyll uses Liquid for site layout and styling; LiquiDoc employs it for prebuilding AsciiDoc source files from small data.

    #     long: |
    #       The future of remote API querying is yours today, for ingesting product information and reshapting it into extremely useful data arrays.
    #       With some up-front planning, writers can have powerful tools for expressing tabular and other product data, including API references.

        short: All the versioning enjoyed by product devs, for docs
        long: |
          No modern product documentation project can go without version control, and the only name in version control is Git.
          Engineers use it to track released editions and versions of the product; the docs can fall into line as well.

        long: |
          This full-featured continuous-integration & -deployment platform has an incredible reputation among DocOps practitioners.
          We love its pricetag (usually nonexistent) nearly as much as its ease of use, jaw-dropping integrations, stellar support, big open-source contributions, and wicked good docs.
